However, a faulty minifier could potentially alter your code's functionality, so it's important to test your site after minifying your CSS."

                "@type": "Answer",
                "text": "Minification is a source code optimization that reduces file size by removing unnecessary characters. Compression (like Gzip or Brotli) is a server-level process that uses algorithms to find and replace repeating patterns in the file, making it even smaller for transmission over the network. Both are crucial for performance."
